#Photo Manipulation Interface

This project demonstrates how to create a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python using Tkinter to manipulate photos. The interface allows users to add a photo, draw on it, change the color and size of the pen, apply filters, enlarge the photo, and rotate the photo.


#Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library
-PIL Library

#Getting Started

1. Download the source code file.

2. Run the code to start the application.
   

#Usage

1. Add Image: Click the "Add Image” button to select an image file. The selected image will be displayed on the canvas.

2. Drawing: Use the mouse to draw on the photo. Select the pen color and size from the respective options.

3. Clear Canvas: Click the "Clear" button to remove all drawings from the canvas.

4. Filters: Select a filter from the combobox to apply it to the photo. The filtered photo will replace the original photo on the canvas.

5. Enlarge Photo: Click the "Enlarge” button to enlarge the photo 

6. Rotate Photo: Click the "Rotate" button to rotate the photo 


#Customization

- To modify the default size of the canvas, update the width and height parameters in the Canvas widget.
